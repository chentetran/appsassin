## Appsassin

Web app used to moderate Assassin games. Very website web app--this is just a prototype for a more advanced face recognition assassin game I was planning on making.

How to play Assassin, from Wikipedia:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A game host secretly and randomly assigns targets to the players. The aim of the game is for players to track down and eliminate their targets until only one player remains. When a player eliminates their target, they get the victim's target(s). Each assassin has only one target at a time. If only one player remains, the game is over.”

Common “assassination” methods include shooting targets with Nerf guns or water guns, throwing a balled up sock at a target, or touching targets in the back of the neck with a spoon. Assassination methods are various and are decided by the game host/players.

Appsassin makes playing assassin easy. The app will be the game host and moderator, so one participant won’t have to sit out to organize the game anymore. It also introduces a new method of assassination where the assassin eliminates targets through snapping a photo of them. The app will use face recognition software to verify the target’s identity. If the photo is valid, the target is eliminated and a new target will be assigned.

### How to use

Sign up for an account by uploading a clear photo of yourself. This web app is best used on mobile, where you can take a photo with the camera for each photo upload.

Create a game by typing in a game name. Have your friends join the game too. Note: you need to refresh in order to see new players in the game lobby. In fact, just keep refreshing all the time because the web page doesn't update automatically.

Once all players are in the lobby, one player should click start and everyone will be assigned a target. Everyone needs to refresh to see their target.

Snap a photo of your target and upload it to assassinate. Win.
