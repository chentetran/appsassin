	<p>At the home screen, enter a game ID to join or create a game. You can use any ID, as long as it isn't already in use.</p>
	<p>When all of your friends are in the same game lobby, start the game. Note: This website doesn't update on its own, so you probably want to refresh every now and then in case a friend has joined the game. You also want to refresh when a friend starts the game.</p>
	<p>You'll get your target. Upload a photo of them to assassinate them.</p>
	<p>This game is best played on your mobile device. This way, you can actually use the real camera instead of uploading a photo of the person that you already have, you cheater.</p>
	<p>Please let Vincent know about any bugs you encounter or any suggestions you have.</p>
